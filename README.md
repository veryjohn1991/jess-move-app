# Overview



## The Challenge

The challenge for our team was to develop a comprehensive event management application that offers a user-friendly interface and extensive functionality. The application needed to enable users to signup and sign in their individual accounts for data search that will help in migration. Our application ensures a seamless user experience, offering secure, responsive, and accessible features across various devices and screen sizes.

Our objectives for this challenge were as follows:

1. Authentication, allowing users to sign up, log in, and log out securely.
2. Enable users to create and save thir accounts
3. Allow users to search data usefull in migration
4. Provide feature for users accurate data income based on most recent cencus.
5. Ensure that the application is responsive and accessible on various devices and screen sizes.

Addressing these objectives, our team delivered an application platform that met the needs of families whom intend to move, thus, streamlining the event planning and participation process.
